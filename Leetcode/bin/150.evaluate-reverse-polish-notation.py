#
# You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic
# expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
# 
# Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the
# expression.
# 
# Note that:
# 
# 
# The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
# Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
# The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
# There will not be any division by zero.
# The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish
# notation.
# The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a
# 32-bit integer.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
# Output: 22
# Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
# = ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
# = ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
# = ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
# = (0 + 17) + 5
# = 17 + 5
# = 22
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4
# tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the
# range [-200, 200].
#

    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        #create a stack to capture and process values

        for char in tokens:
            match char:
                case "+":
                    stack[-1] = int(stack[-2] + stack.pop())
                case "-":
                    stack[-1] = int(stack[-2] - stack.pop())
                case "*":
                    stack[-1] = int(stack[-2] * stack.pop())
                case "/":
                    stack[-1] = int(stack[-2] / stack.pop())
                case _:
                    stack.append(int(char))
        return stack[0]
