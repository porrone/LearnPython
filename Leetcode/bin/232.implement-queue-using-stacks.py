# Testcase Example:  '["MyQueue","push","push","peek","pop","empty"]\n[[],[1],[2],[],[],[]]'
#
# Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The
# implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push,
# peek, pop, and empty).
# 
# Implement the MyQueue class:
# 
# 
# void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
# int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
# int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
# boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
# 
# 
# Notes:
# 
# 
# You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to
# top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
# Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may
# simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you
# use only a stack's standard operations.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input
# ["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
# [[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
# Output
# [null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
# 
# Explanation
# MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
# myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
# myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
# myQueue.peek(); // return 1
# myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
# myQueue.empty(); // return false
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= x <= 9
# At most 100Â calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
# All the calls to pop and peek are valid.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized
# O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take
# overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.
#
